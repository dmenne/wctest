# Wilcoxon from Excel
German Shiny page to compute pairwise Wilcoxon test from data marked with group labels.

Allows for copy/paste of data from Excel.

Creates plots of confidence intervals of pairwise differences, and box-whiskers plot of the raw data, with and with outlier suppression.

By design, no p-values are output, only confidence intervals of the differences. 

You can create sample date to simulate an experiment and observe the horribly different conclusions reached when an experiment is repeated.
